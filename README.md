# Track-Courses

A python script that gives you course times and information, for when UWFlow is down :). 
You can also use it to watch a course, the script queries the waterloo server every minute and emails you when a course has space for you to enroll.

How to use:

- In config.py add your email username and password (assuming you're using gmail, otherwise change the smtp address)
- Run the script by typing `python script.py` or `python3 script.py`
- Follow the instructions on screen and enjoy :)

Note: the script will query as long as its running. If you turn off your computer you will need to restart it.
